### File Descriptions: 

Please refer to [code](/code).

### How to run our project:

Note: Since we used restricted data in our project that cannot be shared, we did not reproduce SQL code since there were >15 tables and billions of rows that were taken into account. All SQL script was run against N3C database that has strict rules on downloading data and/or duplicating tables from their database. As a result, we created a sample of the final dataset that was extracted after applying all exclusion criteria, and generated examples of the types of analyses and predictions our model can make. To run the R code:

  1. Download the file [`Sample_Data.csv`](Sample_Data.csv)
  2. Download the R markdown file [`Stats170 Final Project.Rmd`](Stats170%20Final%20Project.Rmd)
  3. Make sure both these files are in the same directory
  4. Run each codechunk sequentially to view modeling results and other visualizations
  5. To view output of all cells in the notebook, download the .html version of our notebook called [`project.html`](project.html)
